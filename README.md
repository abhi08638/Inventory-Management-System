# Inventory-Management-System
This is a basic inventory management system created in JavaFX 8

This is to showcase knowledge of creating a UI for users with proper preventative exception controls in place to stop user errors. These are implemented in a global way to prevent boiler plate code. I have used Java 8 streams and filters for basic search functionality.

There is a main screen where you search for parts/products in a table. There is functionality to delete parts or products that are not tied to each other. Finally, there is a button to create new parts or products.

List of screens
-------------------
Main Screen, Add Part, Modify Part, Add Product, Modify Product

Parts can be added to Products

Run the Jar file to demo the application.
